# Statement

## Title

# Retail Inventory Management System

---

## Abstract

This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the objectives, scope, deliverables, and timelines for the development and implementation of a new Retail Inventory Management System for **Cornerline Home Goods**.

The project aims to replace the company's manual inventory process, reducing human error, improving inventory accuracy, preventing stock shortages, and providing real-time inventory visibility. **Software Solutions SAS** will be responsible for designing, developing, deploying, documenting, and supporting the system, while Cornerline Home Goods will perform the data migration using its own staff.

---

## Value

The total project value is currently **pending negotiation**.

The estimated value of this project covers the design, development, customization, deployment, maintenance, user training, and post-implementation support for the inventory management system. Payments will be made according to project milestones to ensure alignment with the successful completion of each phase.

The budget also includes software configuration, system documentation, testing, technical support, and maintenance during the first year after deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> On **July 23, 2026**, **Cornerline Home Goods** agreed that the data migration process will be performed by its own staff. Therefore, the labor cost associated with data migration is excluded from this proposal and will be covered by the client.

---

## Scope

The project includes the design, development, deployment, documentation, and support of a Retail Inventory Management System.

The scope includes:

- Item catalog management.
- Real-time inventory quantity tracking.
- Stock-in and stock-out transaction management.
- Inventory adjustment history.
- Low-stock alerts.
- Inventory dashboard.
- Low-stock reporting.
- User authentication with role-based access (Store Staff, Store Manager, and Owner).
- User guide and technical documentation.
- User training.
- One year of post-deployment maintenance.

---

## Payment

The total project cost is currently pending negotiation.

Unless otherwise agreed, payments will be divided into the following milestones:

- 20% upon contract signing.
- 30% upon completion and approval of the system design.
- 30% upon successful completion of development and testing.
- 20% upon deployment, user training, and final project acceptance.

Payments shall be made via bank transfer within fifteen (15) calendar days after invoice submission.

Any work requested outside the agreed project scope will require written approval from both parties and will be billed separately.

# Context

## Present

Cornerline Home Goods currently manages inventory through manual processes, resulting in inaccurate inventory records, delayed stock updates, human errors, and limited visibility of inventory levels.

These issues frequently lead to stock shortages, unnecessary purchases, and inefficient inventory management.

---

## Future

The new inventory management system will centralize inventory operations and provide real-time visibility into stock levels, inventory movements, and reorder alerts.

The solution will improve operational efficiency, reduce inventory discrepancies, and provide management with dashboards that support better business decisions.

The system should also support future enhancements such as barcode scanning, supplier management, purchase orders, and integration with accounting software if required.
